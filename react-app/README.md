## Running the app

### `npm start`

One part I was unsure about was the "filters", the screenshot showed filter for the "name" which I thought was odd since it's not something you'd typically filter one. I went with Gender and Eye Color. Also, I created a table from scratch, I would generally use a prebuilt table component with a well-defined API, but I figured this would be better to showcase development-wise. Also, I didn't integrate any UI/CSS libraries.
